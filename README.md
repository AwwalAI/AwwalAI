To design the architecture and APIs for an application that generates quizzes from user-provided content, presents quizzes to users, checks answers, and generates reports while maintaining history, you can follow a modular approach. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Data Architecture
1.1 Database Models
You’ll need several models to manage the different aspects of the application:

User Model (CustomUser):

Fields: username, email, password, etc.
Django's default or a custom user model can be used.
Document/Content Model:

Stores user-provided content (text, links, files).
Fields: user, file, link, content_type (link/file), created_at.
Quiz Model:

Stores the generated quizzes based on the content.
Fields: user, content (ForeignKey to Document/Content), created_at.
Question Model:

Stores individual questions associated with a quiz.
Fields: quiz (ForeignKey to Quiz), question_text, question_type (objective/subjective), options (for objective), correct_answer.
UserAnswer Model:

Stores user answers to quiz questions.
Fields: user, question (ForeignKey to Question), user_answer, is_correct, submitted_at.
QuizResult Model:

Stores the results of a quiz attempt.
Fields: user, quiz, score, total_questions, correct_answers, created_at.
QuizHistory Model:

Stores a history of all quizzes taken by the user.
Fields: user, quiz (ForeignKey to Quiz), quiz_result (ForeignKey to QuizResult), taken_at.
1.2 Relationships
One-to-Many between Quiz and Question.
One-to-Many between Quiz and QuizResult.
One-to-One or Many-to-One between User and UserAnswer.
One-to-One between QuizResult and QuizHistory.
2. API Design
To support the application's functionality, you'll need several APIs:

2.1 Content Upload API
Purpose: Allow users to upload files or provide a link for content extraction.
Method: POST
Endpoint: /api/content/upload/
Request Body: file, link
Response: content_id, status
2.2 Quiz Generation API
Purpose: Generate a quiz based on the uploaded content.
Method: POST
Endpoint: /api/quiz/generate/
Request Body: content_id, number_of_questions, question_type (objective/subjective)
Response: quiz_id, questions
2.3 Quiz Retrieval API
Purpose: Retrieve the quiz for a user to take.
Method: GET
Endpoint: /api/quiz/<quiz_id>/
Response: quiz, questions
2.4 Answer Submission API
Purpose: Allow users to submit answers to a quiz.
Method: POST
Endpoint: /api/quiz/<quiz_id>/submit/
Request Body: question_id, user_answer
Response: is_correct, score, feedback
2.5 Quiz Result API
Purpose: Retrieve the result of a completed quiz.
Method: GET
Endpoint: /api/quiz/<quiz_id>/result/
Response: score, total_questions, correct_answers, feedback
2.6 User Quiz History API
Purpose: Retrieve a user's quiz history.
Method: GET
Endpoint: /api/user/<user_id>/history/
Response: quiz_history (list of past quizzes with scores and dates)
3. Flow of Operations
User Uploads Content:

The user uploads a file or provides a link.
The content is extracted and stored in the database.
Quiz Generation:

The extracted content is processed, and questions are generated.
A quiz is created and stored with the associated questions.
User Takes Quiz:

The user retrieves the quiz and submits answers.
Answers are checked and stored.
Result and History:

The result is calculated and stored.
The user’s quiz history is updated and can be retrieved later.
4. Additional Considerations
Authentication & Authorization:
Ensure that only authenticated users can access their quizzes and history.
Caching & Performance:
Consider caching quiz data to improve performance.
Logging & Monitoring:
Implement logging for all critical actions to monitor user activity and system performance.
5. Implementation Plan
Define Models: Implement the database models in Django.
Create Views: Implement the API views using Django’s class-based views.
Test APIs: Use tools like Postman to test each API endpoint.
Frontend Integration: Integrate with a frontend or mobile application to make it user-friendly.
Deployment: Deploy the application on a cloud service like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
This architecture and API design provide a robust framework for building a quiz application that handles content extraction, quiz generation, and result tracking effectively.
